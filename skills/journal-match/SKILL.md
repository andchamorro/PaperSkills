  Recommend target journals for manuscript submission. Analyzes manuscript scope,
  discipline, methodology, and language, then searches for similar papers via
  Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex to identify where comparable work is published.
  Enriches journal metadata (h-index, OA status, citation metrics) and produces
  a tiered HTML report ranking journals by scope alignment and impact. Supports
  bilingual output (English / Chinese). Use when the user provides a manuscript
  file, abstract, or topic and asks "where should I publish this?", "find
  matching journals", "journal recommendation", or "venue selection". Do NOT use
  for citation verification, literature review, paper tracking, reference
  management, impact factor lookup without a manuscript, or general bibliometric
  analysis.

Recommend target journals for "$ARGUMENTS".

## INPUT DETECTION

1. Determine input type:
   - **File path** → read with Read tool, proceed to Step 1.
   - **Abstract text** (>50 words, contains academic language) → use directly, proceed to Step 1.
   - **Topic description** (<50 words or non-academic) → ask user for 5-10 keywords and discipline before proceeding.
2. If the input is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify.

## STEP 0 — RETRIEVE SIMILAR PUBLISHED PAPERS (few-shot)

Find 5-10 high-impact published papers similar to the user's submission to guide journal matching. This is the PapervizAgent Retriever→Planner pattern: retrieved examples provide few-shot context for better recommendations.

1. After reading the manuscript (in Step 1), extract: title, 5 keywords, discipline, methodology.
2. Search Semantic Scholar for similar highly-cited papers:
   ```
   GET https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query={keywords}&limit=30&fields=title,venue,year,citationCount,authors,abstract
   ```
3. Filter results:
   - Prefer papers from the last 5 years
   - Prefer papers with >50 citations
   - Prefer papers with matching methodology type
4. Select top 5-10 by: `discipline_match * log(citationCount + 1)`
5. Extract venue distribution from these similar papers — these venues are strong journal candidates.
6. Pass the similar papers list as few-shot context to Step 2 (similar-papers subagent):
   - The subagent should prioritize journals where these similar papers were published.
   - If no similar papers are found, proceed without few-shot examples.

**Fallback:** If Semantic Scholar returns 0 results, broaden to discipline-level keywords. If still empty, skip this step — Step 2 will search independently.

## STEP 1 — EXTRACT MANUSCRIPT PROFILE

1. Read the manuscript or abstract.
2. Extract the following fields into a structured profile:
   - **Discipline**: e.g., law, computer science, medicine, psychology
   - **Sub-field**: e.g., criminal law theory, NLP, oncology
   - **Methodology**: theoretical | empirical | mixed | review | meta-analysis
   - **Scope**: country-specific | comparative | universal
   - **Length**: estimated word count
   - **Keywords**: 5-10 key terms
   - **Language**: English, German, Turkish, Chinese, etc.
   - **Reference profile**: journals cited in the references (candidate journals)
3. If the manuscript is too short (<200 words) or yields fewer than 3 keywords, ask the user to supply additional keywords and discipline context.

## STEP 2 — FIND SIMILAR PAPERS (SUBAGENT)

1. Launch a subagent with the prompt defined in `references/similar-papers-prompt.md`.
2. Pass the manuscript profile fields (keywords, discipline, methodology, language) into the prompt template.
3. The subagent searches Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex for similar papers and returns a venue distribution table. See `references/api-reference.md` for endpoint details.
4. If the subagent finds **zero** similar papers:
   - Broaden keyword search (use individual keywords instead of combinations).
   - Try discipline-level queries (e.g., "criminal law" instead of "criminal law plea bargaining Germany").
   - If still zero, report the limitation and recommend the user consult a librarian or use Scopus/Web of Science manually.

## STEP 3 — ENRICH JOURNAL DATA

1. Take the top 10-15 journals from Step 2.
2. For each journal, retrieve metadata using the APIs described in `references/api-reference.md`:
   - OpenAlex Sources → h_index, works_count, cited_by_count, is_oa, homepage_url, issn
   - CrossRef Journals (if ISSN available) → publication frequency, subject coverage
3. If a journal is **not found** in OpenAlex:
   - Try CrossRef lookup by ISSN.
   - Try name variations (with/without abbreviation).
   - If still not found, mark as "metadata unavailable" and note in the report.
4. Optionally run `scripts/venue_enrich.py` for batch enrichment. Export journal names to JSON and invoke:
   ```
   python scripts/venue_enrich.py --journals journals.json
   ```

## STEP 4 — SCORE AND RANK

1. For each journal, assign a scope match score (1-5):
   - **5**: Journal publishes exactly this type of work (discipline + methodology match)
   - **4**: Close match with minor discipline/scope differences
   - **3**: Related but broader journal
   - **2**: Tangentially related
   - **1**: Poor match
2. Optionally use `scripts/scope_score.py` for structured scoring:
   ```
   python scripts/scope_score.py --profile manuscript_profile.json --journal journal_data.json
   ```
3. Sort journals by: scope score (primary), h-index (secondary).
4. Assign tiers:
   - **Tier 1 — Best Match**: scope score ≥ 4, strong impact metrics
   - **Tier 2 — Good Alternative**: scope score 3-4, solid metrics
   - **Tier 3 — Specialized/Niche**: scope score 2-3, or niche venues with high relevance
5. If all journals are **closed access**, note this limitation and suggest searching for OA alternatives in the same discipline.

## STEP 5 — PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Write a single-file HTML report to: `reports/{date}-journal-match-{slug}.html`
2. Follow the design system in `skills/shared/report-template.md` exactly. Do NOT use Tailwind CDN.
3. Use the structural template in `assets/journal-report-template.md` for the journal-specific layout.
4. Read `references/journal-match-style-guide.md` for tier card styling, scope visualization, and few-shot context display.
4. The report must include:

```
HEADER
  Report tag: "Journal Recommendations"
  Title: manuscript title or topic
  Date: generation date

STATS BAR
  - Journals analyzed: {count}
  - Best match tier: "Tier 1" | "Tier 2" | "Tier 3"
  - Open access: {percentage}%

TIER 1 — BEST MATCH
  For each journal:
  - Journal name (linked to homepage)
  - Scope match: {score}/5 — {one-line reasoning}
  - H-index: {value} · Works: {count} · OA: Yes/No
  - Similar papers found: {count} in last 3 years
  - Notable: "{related paper title}" closely related

TIER 2 — GOOD ALTERNATIVE
  (same card format)

TIER 3 — SPECIALIZED/NICHE
  (same card format)

LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC OPTIONS (if non-English manuscript)
  Journals in the manuscript's language with regional impact

METHODOLOGY NOTE (footer)
  "Recommendations based on venue analysis of similar papers via
   Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex. Scope scores reflect editorial
   alignment, not acceptance probability."
```

5. After writing the file:
   - Return the exact absolute file path to the user.
   - Ask whether they want it opened.
   - Only run `open {file_path}` after the user explicitly confirms.

## STEP 6 — NEXT ACTIONS

Offer follow-up options:
1. "Format manuscript for a specific journal's guidelines?"
2. "Check if your references match what these journals typically cite?"
3. "Draft a cover letter for one of these?"

## ERROR HANDLING

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Manuscript too short (<200 words, <3 keywords) | Ask user for keywords, discipline, and methodology |
| Journal not found in OpenAlex | Try CrossRef by ISSN, then by name variations; mark "metadata unavailable" if all fail |
| Non-English journals | Note reduced metadata coverage; still include with available data |
| All journals are closed access | Note limitation; suggest searching for OA alternatives via DOAJ |
| No similar papers found | Broaden keywords → discipline-level query → report limitation |
| API rate limit or timeout | Retry once after 5 seconds; if still failing, proceed with partial data and note gaps |
| Ambiguous input (not clearly manuscript/abstract/topic) | Ask user to clarify input type |

## TOKEN BUDGET

| Component | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Main session (profile + presentation) | ~5K |
| Similar papers subagent | ~15-20K |
| Journal enrichment | ~5-10K |
| **Total** | **~25-35K** |

## LANGUAGE

1. Determine report language:
   - If the user explicitly requests a language (e.g., "in Chinese", "用中文"): use that language.
   - If the manuscript/input is primarily in Chinese: default to Chinese.
   - Otherwise: default to English.
2. When generating in Chinese:
   - Set `<html lang="zh">` on the HTML document.
   - Write all headings, labels, descriptions, and analysis text in Chinese.
   - Keep technical terms in original form (DOI, journal names, API names).
   - Use Chinese punctuation (，。、；：).
   - Stat-label text in the stats bar: Chinese (e.g., "推荐期刊" not "Journals").
   - Badge text: Chinese (e.g., "最佳匹配" not "BEST MATCH", "开放获取" not "OPEN ACCESS").

## REPORT DESIGN

When writing the HTML report, read and follow the design system in `skills/shared/report-template.md` EXACTLY.
Do NOT use Tailwind CDN. Use the custom CSS variables, font system, and academic book aesthetic defined there.
For the journal-specific report structure, read `assets/journal-report-template.md`.
