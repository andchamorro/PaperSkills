# Experimental Log

## 1. Experimental Setup

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed TSAM method for the Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) task.

### Datasets

- **Ref-AVS Dataset:** We utilized the Ref-AVS dataset containing 20,000 text expressions and pixel-level annotations across 4,000 10-second videos.
- **Object Categories:** The dataset included audible objects (20 musical instruments, 8 animals, 15 machines, 5 humans) and 3 categories of static, inaudible objects.
- **Splits:**
  - Training Set: 2,908 videos
  - Validation Set: 276 videos
  - Test Set: 818 videos total, subdivided into:
    - Seen: 292 videos (categories present in training)
    - Unseen: 269 videos (categories not seen during training; tests generalization)
    - Null: 257 videos (text refers to non-existent/not visible objects; empty true masks)

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Standard Metrics:** We employed the Jaccard Index (J) and F-score (F) for the Seen and Unseen subsets.
- **Null Subset Metric:** We employed the metric S, which measures the ratio of the predicted mask area to the background area. A lower S value indicates better performance.

### Baselines Compared

- **AVS Methods (Augmented with Text):** AVSBench (PVT-v2 backbone), AVSegFormer (PVT-v2 backbone), GAVS (SAM backbone), SAMA (SAM backbone)
- **Ref-VOS Methods (Augmented with Audio):** ReferFormer (Video-Swin backbone), R2-VOS (Video-Swin backbone)
- **Ref-AVS Method:** EEMC (Mask2Former backbone; previous state-of-the-art)

### Implementation Details

- **Model Initialization:** We initialized TSAM using the pre-trained ViT-B variant of SAM (N=12, embedding dimension d_emb=256).
- **Architecture Settings:** The temporal branch consisted of M=4 blocks. The number of selected audio queries was set to k=5.
- **Hardware:** Training was performed on eight AMD GPUs in a distributed setup.
- **Optimizer:** AdamW optimizer was used.
- **Hyperparameters:** Initial learning rate of 1e-4, batch size of 1.
- **Training Duration:** The model was trained for 15 epochs with periodic evaluations.
- **Model Selection:** We selected the best-performing model on the validation subset for testing.

## 3. Qualitative Observations

### Comparisons with State-of-the-Art

- **Backbone Analysis:** We observed that methods utilizing prior segmentation visual backbones (SAM and Mask2Former) generally outperformed those based on PVT-v2 and V-Swin backbones.
- **SAM-Based Baseline Limitations:** Although GAVS and SAMA are SAM-based, they performed worse than EEMC. We noted that SAMA failed to leverage SAM's flexible, promptable nature, and GAVS lacked cohesive multimodal fusion.
- **TSAM Performance:** TSAM achieved the highest performance on both Seen and Unseen test sets. Specifically, TSAM improved over EEMC by 9.23% in Jaccard Index on the Seen set and 5.04% on the Unseen set.
- **Null Set Performance:** TSAM fell slightly behind EEMC on the Null test set (S value 0.017 vs 0.007). We attribute this to SAM's inherent limitation of always attempting to produce a segmentation mask even when no target object is present.

### Ablation Observations

- **Temporal Branch (TB):** Removing the temporal branch caused the most significant performance degradation (Seen Jaccard dropped from 43.43% to 33.05%). This confirmed the critical role of temporal modeling for generalizing across video frames.
- **Prompting Modules (SPM/DPM):** We found that the Sparse Prompting Module (SPM) and Dense Prompting Module (DPM) play complementary roles. Removing both simultaneously resulted in a notable decrease in segmentation performance.
- **Cached Memory (CM):** Omitting cached memory, especially the visual-only memory, degraded performance, highlighting the importance of shared memory for temporal alignment.
- **Adapter Module (AM):** The omission of the adapter module caused a significant performance drop, particularly on the Unseen test set, validating its role in facilitating deep multimodal interaction.
- **Loss Function:** Including the IoU loss improved performance on Seen and Unseen sets but slightly degraded the Null score.

### Hyperparameter Sensitivity

- **Audio Queries (k):** We found that k=5 yielded optimal results. A lower value (k=3) performed well on Seen data but worse on Unseen, while a higher value (k=7) likely introduced irrelevant queries, overloading the decoder.
- **Temporal Depth (M):** M=4 blocks provided the best balance. Shallower setups (M=2) lacked sufficient temporal depth, while deeper setups (M=6) appeared to introduce excessive complexity that impaired generalization.

### Visual Qualitative Analysis

- **Seen Test Set:** We observed that TSAM consistently produced high-quality masks for targeted objects. It successfully segmented inaudible objects when guided by textual cues (e.g., "The object behind the sounding women"), demonstrating effective processing of complex multimodal instructions.
- **Unseen Test Set:** TSAM demonstrated a remarkable capacity to generalize to novel objects. It effectively aligned audio-visual and textual inputs in novel scenes (e.g., segmenting a "truck moving" or "tuba being played" that were not in training categories).
- **Generalization:** The visual results underscored TSAM's ability to preserve SAM's pre-trained knowledge while using the temporal branch to understand dynamic scenes.
